# Hyper-Parameter-Tuning

As we know that there are parameters that are internally learned from the given dataset and derived from the dataset, they are represented in making predictions, classification and etc., These are so-called Model Parameters, and they are varying with respect to the nature of the data we couldn’t control this since it depends on the data. Like ‘m‘ and ‘C‘ in linear equation, which is the value of coefficients learned from the given dataset.

Some set of parameters that are used to control the behaviour of the model/algorithm and adjustable in order to obtain an improvised model with optimal performance is so-called Hyperparameters.

In this particular project i have used ---Grid_searchCV and Randomized_SearchCV
